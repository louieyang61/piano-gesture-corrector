# Piano Hand Posture Recognition: Comparison of Approaches

This project implements two different approaches to detect and classify piano hand postures using computer vision:

1. **Rule-based Approach** (`piano_gesture_recognition.py`): Uses geometric angle calculations and predefined thresholds
2. **Deep Learning Approach** (`piano_posture_dl_classifier.py`): Uses a neural network trained on labeled examples

## Comparison of Approaches

| Feature | Rule-based Approach | Deep Learning Approach |
|---------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Method** | Calculates finger angles and compares with predefined thresholds | Learns patterns from labeled examples using a neural network |
| **Setup Time** | Quick to set up, no training needed | Requires data collection and model training |
| **Accuracy** | Good for standard hand positions | Potentially higher accuracy, especially for complex or personalized postures |
| **Adaptability** | Limited to manually defined rules | Can learn subtle patterns beyond explicit rules |
| **Personalization** | Simple calibration by adjusting angle thresholds | Can be trained on user-specific examples |
| **Computation** | Lightweight, runs efficiently | More computationally intensive |
| **Interpretability** | Transparent rules based on angles | Black-box approach, harder to interpret |

## When to Use Each Approach

### Rule-based Approach is Better When:
- You need a solution working immediately with no training data
- You want simple, interpretable feedback based on clear metrics
- You're running on devices with limited computational resources
- Your application requires consistent, deterministic feedback

### Deep Learning Approach is Better When:
- You want potentially higher accuracy and more nuanced classification
- You have time to collect training data
- You need to recognize patterns beyond simple angle measurements
- You have access to computational resources for training and inference
- Your application benefits from confidence scores for classifications

## Implementation Details

### Rule-based Approach
The rule-based system:
1. Detects 21 hand landmarks using MediaPipe
2. Calculates angles at each finger joint
3. Compares these angles with predefined "ideal" ranges
4. Provides feedback based on whether angles are within range

### Deep Learning Approach
The deep learning system:
1. Detects 21 hand landmarks using MediaPipe
2. Extracts a feature vector of normalized coordinates
3. Passes features through a trained neural network
4. Classifies the hand posture into categories (too curved, good, too flat)
5. Provides feedback with confidence scores

## Measuring Improvement

The deep learning approach can potentially improve detection accuracy by:
1. Learning subtle patterns beyond basic angle measurements
2. Recognizing context-dependent postures specific to piano playing
3. Adapting to individual variations in hand anatomy
4. Being more robust to variations in lighting and hand positioning

We recommend collecting performance metrics for both approaches to quantify the improvement:
- Overall classification accuracy
- Precision and recall for each posture category 
- User satisfaction and perceived accuracy
